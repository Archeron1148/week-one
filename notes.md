making notes

hypothes.is should be introduced in the syllabus really (i made an annotation about that)

PODCAST:

    second layer of difficulty = digital literacy

    failing gloriously:
        -to avoid failing and suffering from it, learn to fail productively
        -academia punishes failure, its competetiveness is not positively oriented to failing productively
        -according to Shawn Graham's study, english archeological studys have almost never disprooved its own hypotheses
        -i would like to know more about the wikipedia story lol
        -the roman text adventure idea i think is very cool
        -classifying fails can help you have strategies to salvage productivity (https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/failure/):
            1. tech failure --> learn the technology
            2. human failure --> learn about people
            3. failure as artifact --> incorporate or pre-empt failure, expect to fail and use it as a way to learn something: study what went wrong
            4. failure as epistemology --> share your failure (so those who come after can learn from it), learn and teach to fail gloriously
            -we must move past overly simplistic views of failure, which treat mistakes as something to learn from and then overcome, and take failure seriously, as a "deeply felt, transformative process that incorporates feelings of anxiety, desperation, confusion, and shame" - Allison Carr (in croxall and warnick)

An Introduction to Digital Archaeology - ODATE

    "It is important at the outset to make the argument that digital archaeology is not about ‘mere’ tool use."
    "Digital archaeology of the 21st century is necessarily a public archaeology."
        -lots of potential for re-use of previous work ('remixing')
        -its a more collaborative effort
    focus of digital archeology has shifted from learning digital tools to actually being able to create digital tools
    
    Is digital archaeology part of the digital humanities?
        -http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/ - some of these follow the meme of "you cant define it" which im sure was a cool and insightful line for the first guy who says "what is x? you cant define it." but each subsequent time it you hear it, it loses value
        "We believe, on balance, that ‘digital archaeology’ sits along this spectrum between justification and discovery closer to the discovery end, that it sits within the digital humanities and we should worry less about hypothesis testing. Rather we might concentrate more on discovery and generation, of ‘interesting way[s] of thinking about this’."
    The ‘cool’ factor and the tensions of cool
        -**Liu argues that cool is ‘the aporia of information… cool is information designed to resist information… information fed back into its own signal to create a standing interference pattern, a paradox pattern’ (Liu 2004, 179).** -The Laws of Cool: Knowledge Work and the Culture of Information
        -That is, Liu argued that ‘cool’ was amongst other things a politics of knowledge work, a practice and ethos. He wondered how we might ‘challenge knowledge work to open a space, as yet culturally sterile (co-opted, jejune, anarchistic, terroristic), for a more humane hack of contemporary knowledge?’ (Liu 2004, 9). Liu goes on to discuss how the tensions of ‘cool’ in knowledge work (for us, read: digital archaeology) also intersects with an ‘ethos of the unknown’, that is, of knowledge workers who work and live inside a system of knowledge production, somehow manage to stand outside of it. Is ‘alt-ac’ (alternative academic) partially ‘alt’ because the cool is at work? This matters for us as archaeologists. There are many ‘cool’ things happening in digital archaeology that somehow do not penetrate into the broader field of archaeology. The utilitarian dots-on-a-map were once cool, but are now pedestrian. The ‘cool’ things that could be, linger on the fringes. If they did not, they wouldn’t be cool, one supposes.
        -"Revisiting science and art: which is more ecological now? Why is art leading the way in promoting radical ecological awareness? The goals of today’s science are modelling, prediction and control. Is that why we turn to art to rediscover the humility that science has lost?" -From Science to Art and Back Again : The Pendulum of an Anthropologist.

    If archaeological materials are excavated but never published, studied but never made available, conserved but never repatriated…. what is archaeology for? -Graham
    digital archeology has a lot of the same ethical issues as tech and academia generally
