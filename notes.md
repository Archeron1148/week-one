PODCAST:

    second layer of difficulty = digital literacy

    failing gloriously:
        -to avoid failing and suffering from it, learn to fail productively
        -academia punishes failure, its competetiveness is not positively oriented to failing productively
        -according to Shawn Graham's study, english archeological studys have almost never disprooved its own hypotheses
        -i would like to know more about the wikipedia story lol
        -the roman text adventure idea i think is very cool
        -classifying fails can help you have strategies to salvage productivity (https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/failure/):
            1. tech failure --> learn the technology
            2. human failure --> learn about people
            3. failure as artifact --> incorporate or pre-empt failure, expect to fail and use it as a way to learn something: study what went wrong
            4. failure as epistemology --> share your failure (so those who come after can learn from it), learn and teach to fail gloriously
            -we must move past overly simplistic views of failure, which treat mistakes as something to learn from and then overcome, and take failure seriously, as a "deeply felt, transformative process that incorporates feelings of anxiety, desperation, confusion, and shame" - Allison Carr (in croxall and warnick)
