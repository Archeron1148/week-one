making notes

hypothes.is should be introduced in the syllabus really (i made an annotation about that)

PODCAST:

    second layer of difficulty = digital literacy

    failing gloriously:
        -to avoid failing and suffering from it, learn to fail productively
        -academia punishes failure, its competetiveness is not positively oriented to failing productively
        -according to Shawn Graham's study, english archeological studys have almost never disprooved its own hypotheses
        -i would like to know more about the wikipedia story lol
        -the roman text adventure idea i think is very cool
        -classifying fails can help you have strategies to salvage productivity (https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/failure/):
            1. tech failure --> learn the technology
            2. human failure --> learn about people
            3. failure as artifact --> incorporate or pre-empt failure, expect to fail and use it as a way to learn something: study what went wrong
            4. failure as epistemology --> share your failure (so those who come after can learn from it), learn and teach to fail gloriously
            -we must move past overly simplistic views of failure, which treat mistakes as something to learn from and then overcome, and take failure seriously, as a "deeply felt, transformative process that incorporates feelings of anxiety, desperation, confusion, and shame" - Allison Carr (in croxall and warnick)

An Introduction to Digital Archaeology - ODATE

    "It is important at the outset to make the argument that digital archaeology is not about ‘mere’ tool use."
    "Digital archaeology of the 21st century is necessarily a public archaeology."
        -lots of potential for re-use of previous work ('remixing')
        -its a more collaborative effort
    focus of digital archeology has shifted from learning digital tools to actually being able to create digital tools
    
    Is digital archaeology part of the digital humanities?
        -http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/ - some of these follow the meme of "you cant define it" which im sure was a cool and insightful line for the first guy who says "what is x? you cant define it." but each subsequent time it you hear it, it loses value
        "We believe, on balance, that ‘digital archaeology’ sits along this spectrum between justification and discovery closer to the discovery end, that it sits within the digital humanities and we should worry less about hypothesis testing. Rather we might concentrate more on discovery and generation, of ‘interesting way[s] of thinking about this’."
    The ‘cool’ factor and the tensions of cool
        -**Liu argues that cool is ‘the aporia of information… cool is information designed to resist information… information fed back into its own signal to create a standing interference pattern, a paradox pattern’ (Liu 2004, 179).** -The Laws of Cool: Knowledge Work and the Culture of Information
        -That is, Liu argued that ‘cool’ was amongst other things a politics of knowledge work, a practice and ethos. He wondered how we might ‘challenge knowledge work to open a space, as yet culturally sterile (co-opted, jejune, anarchistic, terroristic), for a more humane hack of contemporary knowledge?’ (Liu 2004, 9). Liu goes on to discuss how the tensions of ‘cool’ in knowledge work (for us, read: digital archaeology) also intersects with an ‘ethos of the unknown’, that is, of knowledge workers who work and live inside a system of knowledge production, somehow manage to stand outside of it. Is ‘alt-ac’ (alternative academic) partially ‘alt’ because the cool is at work? This matters for us as archaeologists. There are many ‘cool’ things happening in digital archaeology that somehow do not penetrate into the broader field of archaeology. The utilitarian dots-on-a-map were once cool, but are now pedestrian. The ‘cool’ things that could be, linger on the fringes. If they did not, they wouldn’t be cool, one supposes.
        -"Revisiting science and art: which is more ecological now? Why is art leading the way in promoting radical ecological awareness? The goals of today’s science are modelling, prediction and control. Is that why we turn to art to rediscover the humility that science has lost?" -From Science to Art and Back Again : The Pendulum of an Anthropologist.

    If archaeological materials are excavated but never published, studied but never made available, conserved but never repatriated…. what is archaeology for? -Graham
    digital archeology has a lot of the same ethical issues as tech and academia generally

EmboDIYing Disruption: Queer, Feminist and Inclusive Digital Archaeologies

    Digital technologies (especially the Web) were sold to us as democratizing tools that would transform the inequities inherent in communications, research, and institutional structures. When the shortcomings started to become visible, risk and danger were marketed to us as part of what everyone goes through to create good research and art, to innovate, to be successful. But that was not true either: some people are forced to take on more risk than others. 
        -the internet doesn't negate privledge, just makes it harder to see
    This paper will trace the ways in which queer, feminist1, and more broadly inclusive disruptions of traditional forms of communication, values of objectivity, and gate-keeping of knowledge increasingly draw on creative uses of digital and hybrid platforms, taking on many of the goals of transhumanism and posthumanism to unlearn, unmake, unbecome traditional social structures and restrictive identities.
        -where does this unlearning discourse come from? it sounds like it could be a potentially undialectical approach
    ‘Failing is something queers do and have always done exceptionally well.’ The sheer impossibility of ‘succeeding’ through normative models can push these ‘unconventional’ scholars to take greater risks because they already occupy uncharted territory and, therefore, by default take unconventional ‘Do-It-Yourself’ approaches, which in turn blaze a trail for more conventional scholarship to follow (Halberstam, 2011: 6). These ‘rogue intellectuals’ are also more likely to recognize and react to heteronormative representations of the past and fight for inclusive interpretative paradigms.
    it is no stretch to say that feminism in archaeology is multi-dimensional, multi-scalar, and multi-directional. It includes, but is not limited to, making women visible in the past, exploring gender and sexuality, making the discipline more equitable and less exploitative (Wylie, 2001; Conkey, 2003: 867–68; Battle-Baptiste, 2011) as well as using archaeology as broader political action (Wylie, 1997: 84–85). Constantly evolving, ebbing, flowing, and re-evaluating theory and practice, the position of feminism in archaeology is also ever in flux, as is its potential to influence broader discourse, methodologies, and theory.
    Strategic applications of technologies and media to defy, to confront, to derail, to remix, to subvert can be characterized as digital archaeologies that:
        i. confront the archaeological past we have created
        ii. confront the present (particularly of the discipline)
        iii. confront authorship and authority
        iv. act as platforms to support the above.
    technology, contrary to the hopes that it would enhance and overcome human limitations, has in fact opened the door wider for abuse via the Web, particularly for individuals and groups that were already at risk. The publicness of archaeology on the Web has attracted a great deal of attention and developed a global reach, but this can be a double-edged sword.
    When we risk going too far, we discover how far we can go.
    Often forced to choose between the long-term, abstract risk of doing nothing (and, therefore, nothing ever changing for the better) and the immediate and often personal risk of trying to confront the system, the individuals leading the charge of these movements, in the name of equity, security, and inclusivity, face harassment, abuse, suspicion, imprisonment, and violence. This has been part of the growing critique of positive thinking, this ‘mass delusion’ (Ehrenreich, 2010: 13) centred on personal responsibility, where hard work leads to success and poor choices lead to failure, rather than recognizing the true force and pervasiveness of underlying structural conditions (Halberstam, 2011).
    This is perhaps the greatest flaw in transhuman and posthuman philosophies: the unflinching commitment to technology and science to evolve beyond human conflicts and limitations fails to protect humans now, risking the creation of greater fissures rather than making progress. The digital has reformulated the ways in which we engage with the past and produce knowledge in the present, but we have taken many steps backward much faster than the individuals cited above (and many others) have clawed their way forward to envision the past in new ways through creativity, making, and inclusivity.

Co-Creation’s Role in Digital Public Archaeology

    The concept of co-creation as defined by Simon (2010:187) describes a process of collaboration in which individuals or institutions (in this case, archaeologists or archaeological organizations) work with non-specialist communities (e.g., descendant communities, local communities, etc.) to create programs or projects that address the communities’ expressed needs and interests.
        -this raises for me a question: what is the goal of archaeology generally? the argument has been made that it was origionally used in order to justify colonialism. if it is true that we have moved past that, what is its goal now? if the goal involves responding to the a community's needs and interests, what are those needs and interests?
    When engaging in co-creative processes, archaeologists must be ready to share power and authority to create something that meets their own goals and those of their community partners.
    The Digital Engagement Spectrum is a continuum but has four major levels (Figure 1). 
        1. The first consists of publicizing to a wider audience. This type of engagement can disseminate information to a large audience but does not necessarily create a great deal of two-way interaction.
            --following people on twitter, publically viewable facebook pages
        2.The second level of the engagement spectrum includes contributory/participatory projects. Participatory projects try to create engagement by providing users or audiences the opportunity to participate in the platform. 
            --forums, hashtags
        2.5?. crowdsourcing --> Users interact with these platforms by completing well-defined tasks in scaffolded or highly structured participatory frameworks (Ridge 2013b:440). User feedback is considered valuable and generally used to alter and improve the end product. 
            --National Geographic’s Digital Media Survey for the Valley of the Khans project (Lin et al. 2014; National Geographic 2010) is an example of crowdsourcing in archaeology. Volunteer workers review satellite imagery and maps for the Valley of the Khans project and mark anomalies they believe could be man-made structures. 
            --A recent project called MicroPasts(Bonacchi et al. 2014; MicroPasts 2013) allows volunteers to take part in tasks as diverse as transcribing letters and identifying the accurate location of artifact findspots or photo-masking images that are stitched together to make 3D models
        3. The third area of the spectrum describes collaborative proj-ects in which users have some say in determining and refining higher-level goals and design of the program, although the ultimate decision-making still lies with the professional orga-nization...Collaborative projects tend to focus more on understanding and incorporating alternative ways of knowledge production and data...While participatory projects can help interested users under-stand such schema, collaborative projects go beyond that to incorporate ideas and feedback into the design of the project.
        4. Co-creative projects have diverse user groups that help shape the digital application or platform with their perspectives and knowledge. In many cases, the platform is created as a resource for the community, rather than being a platform for the general public.
            --One area in which the co-creative process is very active is in archives and content management systems. Shifting traditional content management and metadata structures to adapt to non-Western ways of viewing or organizing data has been a primary component of digital co-creation.
            --For Mukurtu, this took the form of having access levels map to sociocultural protocols. For the RRN, the content management system was designed to incorporate the variety of different types of information community members wanted to add to object records. Users can verbally record stories about objects using Skype and tag objects using their own vocabulary. What is most important is that the system retains all of user-generated content associated with the record and, like Mukurtu, provides various levels of security that determine what other types of users can see that information. 
 
    issues:
        -Although many digital efforts in the discipline have focused on making archaeological data more open and ensuring that the discipline is more transparent, approaches that aim to share all information do not always mix with many communities’ wishes to make decisions about how their intellectual property is shared. In the same way that archaeology as a discipline has been concerned about sharing sensitive data, so too are aboriginal, indigenous, and descendant communities.
        -It is worth noting, however, that some studies have questioned whether “crowdsourcing” is actually reaching new audiences or just engaging participants already interested in archaeology in a new way (Walker 2014:87).
        -In addition to knowing the scope of users, archaeologists need to be realistic about what audiences can be reached through digital mediums. An inherent part of the co-creative projects discussed above is the necessity of building resources that do not assume computer literacy.
        -**A related concern is whether the target audience actually uses the type of platform the project is based on...The larger lesson is that to build some-thing that has impact, it is important to first try to understand what your audience wants or needs (Finnis et al. 2011). This of course begs the question of how to determine whether a digital engagement project is actually meeting a perceived need. **

    On one end of the spectrum are large-scale digital projects that seek to make archaeological data and content open and interoper-able and archaeological methods more transparent to as many people as possible for them to explore and interpret. On the other end are co-creative projects that create digital resources for particular communities who may or may not choose to circu-late their data.
