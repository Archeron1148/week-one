Week 1 Journal - Archeron1148

>Begin the reflection by quoting (w/ citation) one sentence from the readings that resonates with you:

"If archaeological materials are excavated but never published, studied but never made available, conserved but never repatriated…. what is archaeology for?"
    -Shawn Graham, annotation on "Canadian Digital Archaeology: On Boundaries and Futures"
    
I have chosen this quotation because it got me thinking about what archaeology is for generally. Can it be said that the intention is simply to find out more about the past through analysing archaeological data and artifacts? If this was the original intent and the argument is made that the results of a lot of early archaeological research was the creation of supporting 'evidence' for colonial and racist world-views, can we be sure that we are not making the same mistakes if we are following that same initial intention? The fourth reading (Co-Creation’s Role in Digital Public Archaeology by Elizabeth Bollwerk) suggests that we should "create programs or projects that address the communities’ expressed needs and interests" - I wonder what these needs or interests would be, and how would they effect the results of the research. But now I am thinking that it may be a better approach to state clearly the interests of groups involved in the research, and acknowledging any potential issues that could arise w.r.t. bias, rather than simply stating that the reason for the research is the search for knowledge about the past; That would certainly make the job of anyone who reviews the findings simpler.

>detail any issues you had with getting started, any parts that caused you difficulty
    -reading number 2 would not save to Zotero
    
    -reading on a computer screen is kind of hard for me (and I'm sure many others) for the following reasons:
        --there are so many distractions close at hand
        --its harder to read on web pages where each line of text spans the entire screen, sometimes you can zoom in and the text corrects itself to a more paperback-like amount of words per line, but sometimes they dont (like in reading 3)
        --the non-tactility of it also allows me to lose focus, ive heard its been studied that people generally read better with a paper in your hand and the ability to make notes on the paper than on a computer screen, hypothesis solves one part of this (ability to make notes)
        the solution to this is obviously just to print it out, its an issue of the medium but I doubt its really something that can be changed in the long run
    
    (-I already annotated about introducing hypothes.is to in the syllabus) 

>Going beyond the mere mechanical aspects of getting started, draw on your annotations of what you’ve read (and/or your notes from what you’ve listened to), discuss your idea of what ‘digital archaeology’ might be prior to starting this course, and think through whether any of the materials we’ve seen this week confirm or upset those notions. What kind of archaeology have you encountered so far at Carleton, if at all? Where do you want to go, with digital archaeology?

Origionally I just thought that digital archaeology would involve using digital tools to help in the process of archaeological digging, helping to analyse the data in new ways, and presenting or modeling the findings in new ways (3d virtual representations and 3d printing).
The final reading (Co-Creation’s Role in Digital Public Archaeology) has shown me that it can indeed be more; digital archaeology can be a way to open up archaeological research to a more public audience, and even engage that audience in the research (in a number of different ways (all along The Engagement Spectrum))
I don't think I have personally encountered any kind of archaeology at carleton let alone the digital kind.

I will also add that the readings taught me that digital archaeology also can share many of the same representation issues that are present in both computer science and archaeology (and the arts generally), so "who's voice is being heard?" and questions of a like nature are something that should be always kept in mind. Furthermore, it should be noted that anonymity and the internet generally does not nessesarily negate privledge, it can sometimes simply hide the issue beneath the surface layer.
